	Lab QUESTION 3 : 
		WAP to accept a no from user and check it is prime or not. 
		Pass this number in different function and check it is even or odd. 
		IF number is even than check it is divisible by 10 or not in different function and 
		is no is odd than check it is divisible by 3 or not in different function
